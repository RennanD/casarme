# Positioning Methodology Reference

Based on April Dunford's positioning framework from "Obviously Awesome".

## Core Concept

Positioning defines how your product is the best at delivering something that a well-defined set of customers cares a lot about. It's the context you create for your product — like the opening scene of a movie that orients the viewer.

**Good positioning** triggers assumptions about the product that are TRUE.
**Bad positioning** triggers assumptions that aren't true — leaving sales and marketing to undo the damage.

## The 5 Components (In Order)

The order matters! Starting with competitive alternatives (from Jobs To Be Done theory) ensures positioning is differentiated, not just good-sounding.

### 1. Competitive Alternatives

**Question:** What would customers do if our solution didn't exist?

**Types of alternatives:**
- **Direct competitors**: Similar SaaS/products solving the same problem
- **Indirect alternatives**: 
  - Doing nothing / status quo
  - Manual processes (spreadsheets, documents)
  - Hiring someone (intern, freelancer, agency)
  - Building in-house
  - Using a general tool not designed for this

**How to identify:**
- What did customers use before finding you?
- What do prospects compare you to in sales calls?
- What would happen if your product disappeared tomorrow?

---

### 2. Unique Features/Capabilities

**Question:** What do we have that the alternatives don't?

**Types of unique features:**
- **Functional**: Specific capabilities competitors lack
- **Technical**: Architecture, integrations, performance
- **Experiential**: UI/UX, onboarding, support approach
- **Business model**: Pricing structure, delivery method

**How to identify:**
- List every feature, then cross off anything competitors also have
- Ask customers: "What made you choose us over [alternative]?"
- Look for features that are hard for competitors to copy

**Important:** Features must be provably unique, not just "better" versions of common features.

---

### 3. Value (Customer Benefits)

**Question:** So what? What value do these unique features enable?

**For each unique feature, define:**
- What problem does it solve?
- What outcome does it enable?
- How much time/money/effort does it save?
- What emotional benefit does it provide?

**Value mapping:**
```
Unique Feature → Customer Benefit
Example: Auto-sync with bank accounts → No manual data entry ever
Example: AI-powered categorization → Instant insights without spreadsheet work
```

**Group into Value Themes (max 3):**
Consolidate individual benefits into broader themes to avoid diluted messaging.

```
Value Theme 1: "Effortless setup"
- Feature A benefit
- Feature B benefit

Value Theme 2: "Real-time intelligence"
- Feature C benefit
- Feature D benefit

Value Theme 3: "Enterprise-grade security"
- Feature E benefit
```

### 4. Target Customer Characteristics

**Question:** Who cares a LOT about this differentiated value?

**Define by behaviors and situations, not demographics:**
- What situation makes someone desperately need your value?
- What have they tried before that failed?
- What triggered them to look for a solution?
- What characteristics make them value your differentiators?

**Good target definition:**
- "Teams that outgrew spreadsheets but can't afford enterprise software"
- "Solo founders who need to look professional but have no design skills"
- "Finance managers who spend 10+ hours/month on manual reconciliation"

**Bad target definition:**
- "Small businesses" (too broad)
- "People aged 25-45" (demographics don't indicate need)
- "Anyone who needs a CRM" (doesn't specify why YOUR CRM)

### 5. Market Category

**Question:** What context makes our value obvious to target customers?

**Category selection principles:**
1. **Use existing categories** - Don't create new ones if possible
2. **Add a modifier** - Differentiate within the category
3. **Choose for clarity** - Customer should instantly understand what it is

**Category formula:**
```
[Existing Category] + [Differentiating Modifier]
```

**Examples:**
- CRM → "AI-native CRM"
- Meeting assistant → "Undetectable meeting assistant"  
- Project management → "Project management for creative teams"
- Email client → "Email for people who hate email"
- Accounting software → "Accounting software that does your books for you"

**When to consider category creation:**
Only when:
- No existing category fits at all
- You have significant budget for education
- The new category name is self-explanatory

**Avoid:**
- Made-up jargon ("Revenue Intelligence Platform")
- Categories that require explanation
- Categories competitors will also claim

## Validation Questions

Use these to confirm positioning with the user:

### For Competitive Alternatives:
- "If your product didn't exist, what would your customers use instead?"
- "What do prospects compare you to during sales conversations?"
- "What were your best customers using before they found you?"

### For Unique Features:
- "What can you do that [Competitor A] absolutely cannot do?"
- "What feature do customers mention most when explaining why they chose you?"
- "What would be hardest for a competitor to copy?"

### For Value:
- "When customers describe the benefit, what words do they use?"
- "What metric improves most when customers use your product?"
- "What pain goes away completely?"

### For Target Customer:
- "Describe your best customer - what's their situation?"
- "Who gets the MOST value from your product?"
- "Who should NOT use your product?"

### For Market Category:
- "When you say what you do at a party, what do people immediately understand?"
- "What do customers Google when looking for a solution like yours?"
- "What existing category do you most belong to?"

## Common Positioning Mistakes

1. **Starting with category instead of alternatives**
   - Leads to generic positioning that sounds good but doesn't differentiate

2. **Listing features without mapping to value**
   - Features don't sell; benefits do

3. **Too many value themes**
   - 5+ themes dilutes the message; stick to max 3

4. **Target customer too broad**
   - "Everyone" means no one; narrow focus increases resonance

5. **Creating unnecessary new categories**
   - Requires massive education budget; usually not worth it

6. **Positioning on "better" instead of "different"**
   - "Faster CRM" loses to "CRM that does X which others can't"

```markdown
## Positioning Summary for [Product Name]

"[Product] is a [category + modifier]"

### Competitive Alternatives
What customers would use instead:
1. [Direct competitor 1]
2. [Direct competitor 2]

1. [Feature 1] - [brief description]
2. [Feature 2] - [brief description]

**Theme 1: [Theme name]**
- [Feature 1] enables [benefit]
- [Feature 2] enables [benefit]

**Theme 2: [Theme name]**
- [Feature 3] enables [benefit]

**Theme 3: [Theme name]** (if applicable)
